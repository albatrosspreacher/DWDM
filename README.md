# DWDM
DWDM Mini Project on Sentiment Analysis

We take the dataset `amazon_baby.csv` and do sentiment analysis on the review given by the customers

The three models used are:

1. [Linear Regression](https://github.com/nandiniproothi/DWDM/blob/master/Logistic_Reg.ipynb)
2. [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/nandiniproothi/DWDM/blob/master/Naive_Bayes.ipynb)
3. [SVM Model](https://github.com/nandiniproothi/DWDM/blob/master/SVM_model.ipynb)
